== Scope
This document describes how to develop applications based on the appNG platform.


== Core concepts
An appNG application relies on three core concepts: XML, Java and XSLT. The basic idea is that you define the *structure* of your user interface in XML and implement the *business logic* in Java. Finally, XSLT is the part that bridges the gap between the internal XML based structure and the HTML based user interface.

The following diagram illustrates these core concepts:

Below a short explanation of the diagram's elements:

* *Source-XML* +
The XML files defining the structure of the user interface. +
The following XML schema is used for the source-XML: +
{appng-schema}/platform/appng-platform.xsd[^]
* *Business Logic* +
The implementation of the business logic in Java.
* *Template* +
An appNG Template is a set of resources, used to transform the target-XML into HTML. +
A Template consists of several XSL-stylesheet and all the assets (like JavaScript, CSS, icons) needed to render the HTML. It also contains a `platform.xml` file which is the blue-print for the generated target-XML.
* *Target-XML* +
The target-XML is one single XML document using the template's `platform.xml` as a blue print. This XML document is being enriched with XML fragments that result from combining the static source-XML with the dynamic business logic.
* *HTML* +
The resulting HTML that is delivered to the user's browser.

== The appNG Maven Archetype
An appNG application uses https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven^] as a build system, thus the fastest way to setup an appNG application is to use the appNG Maven Archetype as shown below:
[source,subs="normal"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=mygroupid -DartifactId=myartifactid -DarchetypeGroupId=org.appng -DarchetypeArtifactId=appng-archetype-application -DarchetypeVersion={project-version} -DinteractiveMode=false
